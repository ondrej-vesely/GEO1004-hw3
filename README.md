# GEO1004-hw3
Repository for TU Delft GEO1004 Assignment 3 from 2021. https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo1004/hw/3/
###### Due date: April 9 2021



## Let's keep the repo clean!

### Data
All the data (processed point clouds, shapefiles) files should go into _data folder. This folder isn't synced, to prevent uploading of large files to the repo. **I want to look into using MEGA upload or something similar to synchronize our data that way - Ondrej**.

### Use relative paths
Please try to avoid using absolute paths to your data files whenever possible. Keep your files in the _data under the names which we agreed on and link to them using relative paths.

### General folder structure
Use the folders for the respective codebases. Ideally setup separate folders inside of those for separate processing steps, if you think its better that way.
